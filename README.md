BDX
===

BDX is a small 3D game engine, designed to work with [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) (as an addon), and built to leverage [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), along with the [Bullet physics library](http://bulletphysics.org/) (specifically, the [gbullet](http://code.google.com/p/gbullet/) port). It features a straightforward execution model, supported by a relatively simple API, enabling the programmer to effectively define object behavior within a typical blender scene.

From a "build and deploy" perspective, BDX projects are simply extended libGDX projects, which means that you can use the same gradle-powered pipeline to deploy BDX games to any platform that's currently supported by libGDX (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, HTML5, Android and iOS).

Status
------

The project is currently in alpha, as it has yet to be tested on platforms other than the one it was developed on (Arch Linux).
